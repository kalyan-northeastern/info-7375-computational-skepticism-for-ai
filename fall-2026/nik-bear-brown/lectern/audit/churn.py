"""churn.py — are these real jobs that turn over, or postings that sit there?

    python3 churn.py                                  # every runs/*/all-jobs-*.json, newest run is "today"
    python3 churn.py --extra path/to/all-jobs-2026-09-26.json   # add a snapshot kept elsewhere
    python3 churn.py --write                          # also write churn-<date>.{md,json} next to today's run

What it can see. Each run is a snapshot of every posting open on a board that day, with the date the board says
it was first published. From snapshots alone it measures:
  age       how long today's open postings have been up (today minus the board's own posted date)
  flow      between two snapshots: postings that appeared, postings that disappeared, and how many
            of the ones that appeared look like a re-post (same company, title, place and department as
            one that disappeared)
  lifetime  if a board's open count is steady, mean days a posting stays up is about
            (average open postings) / (postings closed per day). Little's law. It is printed only with
            the evidence that the board was roughly steady, and marked when it was not.
  age at disappearance   how old closed postings were when we last saw them (a floor on how long they stayed)

What it cannot see. A posting that disappears was filled, cancelled, merged into another, or re-posted under a
new ID. Nothing in a public board says which. So "closed" is never "hired", and the report says so. A board's
posted date can be reset when the company edits or re-posts, which makes postings look younger than they are.
Two or three snapshots give a window, not a trend; the measure improves as runs accumulate.

Stdlib only. Reads the full snapshots, which stay on the machine that made them.
